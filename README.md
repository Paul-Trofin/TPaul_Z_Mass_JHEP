## Delphes Macro Files Generator
### ~one python file~

---

*** This python script stands as the base code for generating 
the required files to run Delphes with Pythia8 together,
using the "./DelphesPythia8" optional executable shipped
with Delphes.

*** The first part of "generate_delphes_macros.py" contains 
the options section in which you enter the <name> of the 
folder in which the following files will be created:

- The input "<name>.cmnd" file is generated by writting 
  strings in Pythia8 format. Options are availabe for this 
  part.

- The analysis "get_variables.C" ROOT file is created
  automatically the same. It extracts information from 
  the output <name>.root and writes "variables.root"
  in which the following trees will be created:
  - Electrons
  - Positrons
  - Dielectrons
  - Jets
  
  This file is used for analyzing the dielectrons final
  state.
  
  No actual options included in the python script, change
  manually if you want.

*** Let's run the default example step by step:

```bash
python3 generate_delphes_macros.py   # ff_Z_ee folder should be created.
cd ff_Z_ee
